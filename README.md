🧠 **What It Is**  
A **multithreaded proxy server–client architecture** is a network model where the **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client and the main server. It forwards client requests and relays server responses back—often adding a layer of filtering, anonymity, or caching.

---

⚙️ **How It Works**  
- The **client** sends a request to the proxy server instead of directly contacting the target server.  
- The **proxy server**, using **multithreading**, handles **multiple client requests simultaneously**, improving speed and responsiveness.  
- Each **thread** manages a separate client connection, ensuring efficient load handling without bottlenecks.  
- Once the proxy receives the server’s response, it returns it to the correct client.

🚀 **Why Multithreading Matters**  
- Enables **concurrent processing** for real-time performance  
- Reduces **latency** under heavy traffic  
- Improves **scalability** for large networks and web applications
